# Global-CO2-Emissions-Tracker-by-Sector
In this project, I analyzed global CO₂ emissions data to identify top polluting countries and understand long-term trends across energy, transport, and industry sectors. I started by researching and selecting a multi-year emissions dataset. After acquiring the data, I cleaned and prepared it using Python—handling missing values, formatting columns, and calculating additional metrics like per capita and per GDP emissions. I then used Tableau to design an interactive dashboard, including heatmaps, bump charts, and KPI summary tiles to visualize emissions by country and over time. Finally, I created a policy brief highlighting key insights about the highest emitting nations and offered recommendations based on their historical trends. This project combines data science and storytelling to support climate action through better awareness.
